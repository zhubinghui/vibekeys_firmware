# VibeKeys

English | [中文](docs/README_zh.md)

> An ESP32-S3 Rust firmware that turns a custom keypad into a Bluetooth keyboard with speech-to-text (streaming audio to a Whisper service), an LCD UI, MQTT remote control, and OTA updates.

VibeKeys is a Rust firmware for the **ESP32-S3** that turns a piece of custom hardware — screen, keys, and microphone — into a versatile input device:

- **Bluetooth keyboard (BLE HID)** — custom keys act directly as keyboard input to your phone or computer.
- **Voice input** — press the MIC key and speak; the mic audio is first processed by the [esp-sr](https://github.com/espressif/esp-sr) audio front-end (webrtc noise suppression / auto gain), then streamed as a WAV over HTTP to a Whisper service you configure for recognition; the returned text is "typed" into the host through the Bluetooth keyboard. You can also turn off the built-in ASR and pass the mic through to the host to use the host's own dictation.
- **Remote terminal** — connects to the companion **vibetty** over MQTT, sharing / remotely driving the screen and interaction in real time.

## ⚠️ Upgrade note (0.3.x → 0.4.0)

0.4.0 makes **breaking changes** to the partition layout (symmetric 4 MB/4 MB OTA slots) and the WiFi-related parts. **Upgrading from 0.3.x to 0.4.0 cannot be done via OTA** — you must perform a **full USB flash** of the bootloader, partition table, and firmware (use one of the `*_bin` images, e.g. `vibekeys.bin`). This **invalidates previous settings** (WiFi / MQTT server / ASR, stored in NVS); you'll need to reconfigure after upgrading.

## Key features

- **Two modes**: `Keyboard` (Bluetooth keyboard + ASR) and `Remote` (MQTT remote).
- **ASR (voice input)**: two trigger styles — PTT (push-to-talk) and Toggle (tap to toggle); recognition is done by an HTTP Whisper service (set `asr_config` in `setup.html`: `uri` / `api_key` / `model`); "prefer built-in ASR" can be toggled in settings.
- **Dual-format remote screen**: JPEG mode (full-frame images, long buffer for local scroll-back) and text mode (vt100 terminal emulation with ANSI colors, incremental dirty-rect rendering). The firmware auto-detects the format from vibetty's presence announcement.
- **LCD UI**: the SPI display renders the keyboard view / remote view / terminal / status; optional I2C OLED (`i2c_oled`).
- **Web provisioning**: with the device in **Keyboard mode**, open `setup.html` to configure WiFi, MQTT broker, ASR, MIC mode, etc. over Web Bluetooth; stored in NVS.
- **Dual-partition OTA**: the firmware writes the new image to the inactive OTA partition and reboots into it. Two update sources: browser upload (HTTP PUT), or **download-latest** directly from GitHub releases.
- **SNTP**: queries multiple NTP servers in parallel (for HTTPS certificate validation).

## Operation

A **boot menu** always appears at startup with three entries — **Keyboard**, **Remote**, **Setting**. Move with **NEXT** (forward) and **ESC** (back); confirm with **ACCEPT**.

### Keyboard mode (BLE HID + ASR)

The custom keys act as a Bluetooth keyboard. Default keymap (overridable via keymap config):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| ACCEPT | Enter |
| BACKSPACE | Backspace |
| ESC | ESC |
| NEXT | ↓ (Down arrow) |
| SWITCH (YOLO) | Shift + Tab |
| CUSTOM | types `/compact` + Enter |
| MIC | Ctrl + Option (trigger host dictation), **or** voice input when built-in ASR is on |
| Rotary push | types `/` |
| Rotary up / down | mouse wheel up / down |

**Voice input (MIC)**: when "prefer built-in ASR" is on and an ASR service is configured, MIC triggers recognition. Two trigger styles (set MIC mode in `setup.html`): **PTT** — hold to record, release to send; **Toggle** — tap to start/stop. The recognized text is typed through the Bluetooth keyboard.

### Remote mode (MQTT → vibetty)

Remote mode connects to the vibetty bridge over MQTT. It does **not** bind to a single session — it subscribes to presence for **all of your sessions at once** (`{user}/+/+/vibetty`, retained), so every vibetty terminal you have running shows up, and you can **switch between them on the fly** without reconnecting.

On entering Remote mode the **session picker opens automatically** (it waits briefly for sessions to arrive).

> **Press the rotary knob at any time to (re)open the picker** and switch which session is displayed.

In the **session picker** each session is one row. Its label color reflects that session's live agent state, and the focused row is highlighted separately:

- **white** label — the session is **working** (agent running);
- **orange** label — the session has **stopped** (idle / waiting);
- **blue** background — the currently focused row.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| NEXT | move focus to the next session |
| ACCEPT | select the focused session and make it active |
| ESC | close the picker without changing |

While viewing a **remote terminal**:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| Rotary up / down | scroll the terminal (local pan, then ScrollUp / ScrollDown) |
| ACCEPT | send Enter |
| ESC | send ESC |
| NEXT | send ↓ |
| BACKSPACE | send Backspace |
| CUSTOM | types `/compact` |
| SWITCH | Shift + Tab |
| Rotary push | open the session picker |
| MIC | local voice input (PTT / Toggle); after recognition, an inline editor lets the rotary move the cursor and ACCEPT submit the text |

When you scroll past the edge of the local buffer, the device asks vibetty for the previous/next page and pops up a `loading...` hint until the new frame arrives.

**JPEG mode**: a tall image buffer (3 screen heights) lets you pan locally; when you reach the top/bottom the device requests the next page from vibetty.

**Text mode**: a vt100 terminal canvas (3 screen heights on max2, 5 on keys) with incremental dirty-rect rendering. The rotary pans the visible window locally; at the canvas edges it sends `scroll_up` / `scroll_down` to vibetty for older/newer history. Delta frames are throttled (≤10 renders/s) and only the changed cells are flushed, keeping the UI responsive during high-frequency output.

### Setting

Entered from the boot menu. Options: **WiFi networks**, **OTA Update**, **Clear config**. Move with **NEXT** (or the rotary in sub-screens), pick/edit with **ACCEPT**, delete with **BACKSPACE**, go back with **ESC**. **OTA Update** enters OTA mode in-process (same firmware, no rescue reboot): it connects WiFi, starts an HTTP server for browser upload, and offers a **download-latest** button to fetch the newest firmware from GitHub releases. **Clear config** wipes NVS and reboots.

## Multiple WiFi (wifi_list)

The device keeps a **list of WiFi credentials** (`wifi_list`) rather than a single network. On boot it scans the surroundings and **connects to the first network in the list that is currently in range** — the list order is the priority order.

The point of a list is **mobility**: so the device can follow you between places — **office → café → home** — and come back online at each one without reconfiguring WiFi on the spot. Configure every network you use once (under **Setting → WiFi networks**, or via `setup.html` during provisioning); after that the device picks the right one automatically, wherever you happen to be.

- List order = priority: the first entry whose SSID is visible in the scan wins.
- Up to **8** credentials are stored in NVS (`MAX_WIFI_CREDS`).
- Every mode and the OTA rescue firmware share the same list and the same priority logic, so an over-the-air update also connects from wherever you are.

## Setup (web provisioning)

The firmware stores its configuration (WiFi networks, MQTT broker URL, ASR service, MIC mode, etc.) in NVS and reads it on boot. You configure all of it through a single web page — **`setup.html`** — which is now hosted online:

> 🌐 **Open the provisioning page:** <https://zhubinghui.github.io/vibekeys_firmware/>

This page configures **WiFi** and the **MQTT broker URL** (and the rest of the settings) for this hardware. It talks to the device over **Web Bluetooth (BLE)** — no cable, no app:

1. Boot the device into **Keyboard mode** (from the boot menu). In this mode the device advertises a BLE GATT service that exposes its configuration.
2. Open the provisioning page above in a Web-Bluetooth-capable browser (Chrome / Edge, over HTTPS), and click **Connect to VibeKeys**.
3. Pick the device, fill in your WiFi networks, MQTT broker URL, ASR / MIC settings, etc., and save — the page writes the config to the device over BLE, and the device stores it in NVS.

> 💡 **Can't find the device in the picker?** The device stops BLE advertising once a host (your PC/phone) is already connected to it as a keyboard. Press the **ACCEPT** key on the device to re-start BLE advertising, then try connecting again.

You can re-run this any time settings change.

## Hardware

ESP32-S3 + PSRAM (octal), SPI LCD, I2S microphone, custom keys, optional I2C OLED.

## Building

Built on [Rust + ESP-IDF](https://github.com/esp-rs), target `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf`. Common commands:

```bash
./build.sh keys_bin      # main firmware merged image (bootloader + partition + app): vibekeys.bin
./build.sh max2_bin      # max2 hardware variant (--features max2)
./build.sh keys          # OTA image (app only, for OTA upload / download-latest)
./build.sh max2          # max2 OTA image
./build.sh keys_ota_bin  # factory image (app in ota_0 slot): vibekeys.bin
./build.sh max2_ota_bin  # max2 factory image: vibekeys_max2.bin
```

See `./build.sh` for the full list of targets. Feature flags: `max2` (max2 hardware variant), `i2c_oled` (I2C OLED).

> The OTA partition layout is symmetric (`ota_0` / `ota_1`, each 4 MB). The `*_bin` images include the bootloader + partition table for first-time flashing; the bare `keys` / `max2` images are app-only for OTA updates.
